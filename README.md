# electoral-votes-array


This repository contains a simple program that simulates electoral votes using arrays. The program allows users to cast their vote for predefined candidates and later displays the voting results. The goal of the project is to provide an example of how to use arrays to manage electoral votes.

Operation
The program allows users to vote for predefined candidates using numbers from 1 to N, where N is the total number of candidates. The votes are recorded in an array and at the end of the voting they are counted to determine the winner.
